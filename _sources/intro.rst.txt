About NGEE-Tropics
------------------

Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments–Tropics (NGEE-Tropics) [NGT]_ is a DOE-funded,
multi-institutional project led by Berkeley Lab [LBL]_, focused on how
tropical forests interact with Earth’s climate. Tropical forests cycle more CO2 and water than
any other ecosystem, and play critical roles in determining Earth’s energy balance. Intact tropical
forests are also estimated to be Earth’s largest carbon sink, yet the stability of this sink is
susceptible to a warming climate and disturbance processes. Understanding of carbon and related
water and energy exchanges between tropical forests and the atmosphere lags that of other ecosystems,
and poor model representation of these processes is the most significant source of terrestrial
uncertainty in projections of Earth’s future climate.


The Data Archive
----------------
The NGEE-Tropics archive service sits in the middle of the *NGEE Tropics data workflow*
(see :numref:`fig-dataworkflow`).

* Place to upload datasets and metadata.
* Datasets should consist of related data collections, not individual files (e.g. Sapflow collected at Manaus)
* Datasets will receive a DOI, and can be updated with new data.
* Datasets will be available for search to NGEE Tropics team, and (if policy allows) to public
* Makes NGEE-Tropics compliant with DOE Data Management Plan
